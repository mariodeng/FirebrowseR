\title{Retrieve CDEs normalized by Firehose and selected for analyses.}
\usage{
Samples.Clinical_FH(format = "csv", cohort = "",
  tcga_participant_barcode = "", fh_cde_name = "", page = 1,
  page_size = 250, sort_by = "cohort")
}
\arguments{
\item{format}{A string identifying the data type returned. Using json
requires the jsonlite package. \code{json}, \code{csv} or \code{tsv} are
available. In this package \code{tsv} and \code{csv} are identical.}

\item{cohort}{A character vector indicating the cohort to query,
empty string queries all cohorts. See \code{\link{Metadata.Cohorts}} for
available cohorts.}

\item{tcga_participant_barcode}{A character vector containing TCGA Barcodes.
Empty string returns all patients. Either one gene OR barcode is required.}

\item{page}{Subset to be returned.}

\item{page_size}{Number of records per page, max. is 2000.}

\item{sort_by}{character indicating the to column which is used for sorting.}

\item{fh_fh_cde_name}{Retrieve results only for the CDEs specified from the
scrollable list.}
}
\value{
A \code{list}, if format is \code{json}, elsewise a \code{data.frame}
}
\description{
This service returns patient-level clinical data elements (CDEs) that have
been normalized by Firehose for use in analyses. Results may be selected by
disease cohort, patient barcode or CDE name, but at least one cohort, barcode
or CDE must be provided. When filtering by CDE note that only when a patient
record contains one or more of the selected CDEs will it be returned. Visit
this table of CDEs to see what's available for every disase cohort (\url{http://gdac.broadinstitute.org/runs/info/clinical});
for more information on how these CDEs are processed see our pipeline
documentation \url{https://confluence.broadinstitute.org/display/GDAC/Documentation#Documentation-ClinicalPipeline}
